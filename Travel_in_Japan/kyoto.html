              A passageway to Japan's past, full of World Heritage sites and
              traditional arts
            </h2>
            <p>
              Kyoto (京都, Kyōto) served as Japan's capital and the emperor's
              residence from 794 until 1868. It is one of the country's ten
              largest cities with a population of 1.5 million people and a
              modern face. Over the centuries, Kyoto was destroyed by many wars
              and fires, but due to its exceptional historic value, the city was
              dropped from the list of target cities for the atomic bomb and
              escaped destruction during World War II. Countless temples,
              shrines and other historically priceless structures survive in the
              city today. The shrines and temples of Kyoto offer a rare link
              between modern life in the city and its very ancient past. The
              Shimogamo Shrine dates to the 6th century and seems suspended in
              time, its serenity and spiritual power still palpable. Visit
              Fushimi Inari Shrine, then see the life-sized Thousand Armed
              Kannon statues of Sanjūsangen-dō. Take in traditional geisha
              performances, then savor a tranquil meal at a restaurant
              overlooking the Kamo River.

            <p>
              Tokyo and Kyoto are connected with each other by the JR Tokaido
              Shinkansen. Nozomi trains require about 140 minutes to reach Kyoto
              from Tokyo, Hikari trains about 160 minutes and Kodama trains
              about four hours. The regular one way fare from Tokyo to Kyoto is
              13,320 yen for a non-reserved seat or around 14,000 yen for a
              reserved seat. A 7-day Japan Rail Pass costs about the same as
              regular round trip tickets. The Japan Rail Pass is valid on Hikari
              and Kodama trains, but not on Nozomi trains.

            </p>
            <p>
              The one way trip from Tokyo to Kyoto by highway bus takes about
              7-8 hours. There are daytime and overnight buses. Fierce
              competition on the Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka route has produced a wide
              variety of comfort levels (from discount to super premium buses)
              and an abundance of low priced offers. Typical one way fares for
              discount buses, such as Willer Express, start from around 3500
              yen; while premium buses charge up to 10,000 yen. If used
              effectively, the Japan Bus Pass can reduce the cost for the bus
              trip to around 3000 yen. Online reservations can be made through
              Willer and Japan Bus Online.

              The closest airport to Kyoto is Osaka's Itami Airport, about one
              hour by bus from central Kyoto (more details). Most flights
              connect Itami Airport with Tokyo's Haneda Airport, with just a few
              serving Tokyo's Narita Airport. Flight duration is one hour. The
              regular one way fare is around 23,000 yen, but discount tickets
              are usually available for around 9,000 to 16,000 yen.

              By local trains, the one way trip from Tokyo to Kyoto takes about
              nine hours and typically involves about four transfers of trains.
              The regular fare is a relatively expensive 8360 yen, however, with
              a Seishun 18 Kippu you could theoretically do the trip for as
              little as 2410 yen.

              The JR Tokaido Shinkansen requires 15 minutes and costs 1440 yen
              for an unreserved seat between not so centrally located Shin-Osaka

              "Special rapid" trains on the JR Kyoto Line require about 30
              minutes and cost 570 yen between centrally located Osaka Station
              and Kyoto Station. Stopping at a few more stations along the way,
              "rapid" trains require about 40 minutes and "local" trains about
              45 minutes, but they are often less crowded. The one way fare is

              Kyoto features a rectangular street system. Unlike the streets in
              other Japanese cities, most of central Kyoto's streets are named.
              The main streets running from east to west are numbered in
              ascending order from north to south, and are about 500 meters
              apart from each other, with several smaller streets in between.
              For example, Shijo means "4th Avenue" and Nijo means "2nd Avenue".
              Kyoto's city center with the highest concentration of dining,
              shopping and entertainment opportunities, is located around the
              junction of Shijo-dori (4th Avenue) and Kawaramachi-dori
              (Kawaramachi Street). JR Kyoto Station is located south of the
              city center at the height of Hachijo-dori (8th Avenue). The most
              prominent north-south street is Karasuma-dori (Karasuma Street),
              which runs from Kyoto Station via the city center to Kyoto
              Imperial Palace. Another north-south axis is Kamo River, about one
              kilometer east of Karasuma-dori. Kyoto has a rather inadequately
              developed public transportation system for a city of its size,
              consisting of two subway lines, a dense bus network and several
              railway companies, whose lines are not always conveniently
              connected with each other. Taxis and bicycles can be worthwhile
              alternatives. The recommended way to get around Kyoto by public
              transportation is to use an IC card, such as Icoca, which is
              accepted on virtually all trains and buses in the city.
              Alternatively, travelers intending to use buses or subways
              extensively, should consider one of the 1-day passes available

                  Fushimi Inari-taisha (伏見稲荷大社) is the head shrine of the
                  kami Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture,
                  Japan. The shrine sits at the base of a mountain also named
                  Inari which is 233 metres (764 ft) above sea level, and
                  includes trails up the mountain to many smaller shrines which
                  span 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) and take approximately 2 hours to
                  walk up. Inari was originally and remains primarily the kami
                  of rice and agriculture, but merchants and manufacturers also
                  worship Inari as the patron of business. Each of Fushimi
                  Inari-taisha's roughly thousand torii was donated by a
                  Japanese business. Owing to the popularity of Inari's division
                  and re-enshrinement, this shrine is said to have as many as
                  32,000 sub-shrines (分社 bunsha) throughout Japan.

                  Arashiyama (嵐山) is a pleasant, touristy district in the
                  western outskirts of Kyoto. The area has been a popular
                  destination since the Heian Period (794-1185), when nobles
                  would enjoy its natural setting. Arashiyama is particularly
                  popular during the cherry blossom and fall color seasons.
