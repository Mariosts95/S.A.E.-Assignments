        <p id="hero-info-content">Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of
        Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and
        philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful
        men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the
        Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an
        armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against
        terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret
        identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly revealing himself as Iron Man.</p></div>
